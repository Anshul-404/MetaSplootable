# Vulnerability Assessment Project on Metasploitable2

## Overview

This repository contains a detailed vulnerability assessment of Metasploitable2, an intentionally vulnerable virtual machine designed for training and educational purposes in the field of cybersecurity. The assessment covers various services and applications, documenting identified vulnerabilities, their impacts, and mitigation strategies.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into folders named after the service being assessed, formatted as `ServiceVersion_PortNo`. Each folder contains:

- A Markdown report (`ServiceVersion_PortNo.md`) detailing the findings according to the following sections:
  - **Introduction**: Overview of the service and the scope of the assessment.
  - **Exploit Details**: Technical details of the vulnerabilities found, including CVE numbers where applicable.
  - **Impact Analysis**: Evaluation of the potential impact of the vulnerabilities on the system.
  - **POC (Proof of Concept)**: Demonstrations or scripts showing how the vulnerabilities can be exploited.
  - **Patches and Updates**: Information on available patches or updates to address the vulnerabilities.
  - **Mitigation**: Strategies and recommendations for mitigating the vulnerabilities to secure the system.
  - **References**: Links to external resources, articles, and documentation that support the assessment findings.
  - **Conclusion**: Summary of the assessment, including the overall risk and recommendations for future security posture improvements.
- An `Scripts` folder containing all relevant exploit scripts, codes, or PoC files used during the assessment.

## Methodology

The vulnerability assessment was conducted following a comprehensive methodology, ensuring a thorough examination of Metasploitable2's services and applications. This included:

- Reconnaissance to gather preliminary information.
- Scanning and enumeration to identify services and potential vulnerabilities.
- Detailed analysis and exploitation of vulnerabilities.
- Documentation of each step, findings, and recommendations for mitigation.

## Tools Used

This project utilized various cybersecurity tools, including but not limited to:

- **Nmap**: For port scanning and service identification.
- **Metasploit Framework**: For developing and executing exploit code.
- Additional tools and scripts were used as needed (especially from ExploitDB), detailed within each service's documentation.

## Ethical Considerations

All activities and findings documented in this project were conducted ethically, with a focus on educational purposes and improving security. The exploits and methods described are intended for use in controlled environments by cybersecurity professionals.

## Disclaimer

The information in this repository is for educational and research purposes only. Usage of the exploits and techniques against systems without explicit permission is illegal and unethical.
